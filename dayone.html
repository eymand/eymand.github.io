								<h2>Afternoon Session 1 - Being an Author</h2>
								<p>How To: Author, Scholar, Presenter: A focused discussion on the roles and responsibilities of the author in the publishing cycle. We'll talk about your experiences and also about the author-editor and author-peer-reviewer relationships.</p>
<p>During this session, we'll look at some biosketches and we'll start drafting or reviewing one that we can use as a starting point whenever we need one for a publication or project (this task might carry over to the first afternoon session). We'll also set up ORCID IDs and optionally add entries to the Writing Studies Tree (but only if you are in a writing studies field).</p>

								<h2>Afternoon Session 2 - Finding and Responding to CFPs</h2>
								<p>In this final session, we'll look at resources for finding Calls for Papers (CFPs), how to read them, and how to make a plan for crafting a proposal. We'll start work on the Journal or Chapter Proposal assignment.</p>
								
<h3>Journal or Chapter Proposal</h3>
<p>For this assignment, your task is to find a CFP (Call for Papers) for a journal, journal special issue, or edited collection. You may already have one in mind, and you may also already have an abstract drafted - you can use that if you like, as long as you haven't already submitted it. If you don't already have a proposal, your task is to write one, making sure to respond to the requirements of the CFP. As we learn more about editing and publishing in our fields, you should use what you've learned to refine the proposal draft. We'll peer-review our proposals on Friday.</p>

								<h2>Homework</h2>
              <p>Begin working on Journal Investigations - you'll present your findings tomorrow afternoon.</p>
								<h3>Journal Investigation</h3>
<p>First, select a journal that is important in your field; ideally one that you would like to publish in. Your goal is to create a rubric that will help you to align your work with the aims, audiences, and requirements of that journal.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gather Data
<ul><li>Find and make a copy of the journal's goals or mission statement. If there are statements about scope, methods, or audience(s), be sure to make copies of those as well.</li>
<li>Examine the last few years of the journal's publications. Identify the different sections (if there are any) and what those sections publish. There is also usually an editor's introduction each issue: be sure to read a few of those. Make notes about what the published articles can tell you about the scope and audience of the journal. Make note of any specific articles that you might draw on or cite in your own projects.</li>
<li>Look for information about how the journal applies peer-review and make note of it.</li>
<li>Look for a list of reviewers and/or editorial board members. Note any whose work you already know aligns with your own interests.</li>
<li>Look at the submissions guidelines and note any requirements that you aren't familiar with or that you feel like you need to know more about. What format should submissions be in? Do you upload or email? Is a query required before submitting a draft? What citation format is in use?</li>
<li>Look for and record any relationships the journal has to organizations in the field.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Craft the rubric
<ul><li>Use the data you gathered to help you write a one page cheat sheet that will help you with submissions to that specific journal. Include information about scope, audience, structure, and key submission requirements. This is not an essay - be sure to format in a way that will be most helpful to you - it might be a table, or bulleted lists, for instance.</li>
<li>Ideally, you will do this for any journal you aim to submit to, but for now, we'll start with just this one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Present your findings. <ul><li style="list-style-type: none">Finally, you'll need to create a presentation explaining what you found (you'll present this tomorrow afternoon). The presentation should be more capacious than the cheat sheet - you can provide more details, explain more about how you think the journal fits in the field, and tell us about a favorite article or two from the last 3 years. Feel free to also note any key works that are older that you find particularly compelling or useful.</li></ul></li>
